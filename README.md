# KNN-Algorithm
Performed K nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm on 2 different datasets

The present project talks about K nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. K nearest neighbors algorithm is a simple algorithm used for both classification and regression. It is a non-parametric algorithm and is widely used because it is easy to interpret and understand it. It is a lazy algorithm which classifies new cases on the basis of previously stored cases. It has many industrial applications and usages. Some of them can be medical data mining, recommendation systems, facial recognition, anomaly detection, loan management, credit rating, forest inventory evaluation, fingerprint detection etc.

The present project has two parts: Part A and Part B. Both the parts involve different datasets for carrying out the K nearest neighbors algorithm. Part A involves Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and Part B involves Wine dataset. The same set of rules/algorithm is run on both to find out the results.
